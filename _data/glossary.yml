adt: "HL7 <i>Admit/Discharge & Transfer</i> messages carry patient demographic information for HL7 communications but also provide important information about trigger events (such as patient admit, discharge, transfer, registration, etc.). Some of the most important segments in the ADT message are the PID segment, the PV1 (Patient Visit). ADT messages are extremely common in HL7 processing and are among the most widely used of all message types."
api: "The term <i>Application Programming Interface</i> is quite a confused term in the context of FHIR. Strictly speaking, an API is a set or services offered by a programming library that can be made use of by another application. Historically these would have been made available from a single machine although now they are available across networks.<br><br>In the service/message/document categorisation, an API is a service interface although many don’t consider it so. As technology became increasingly capable of supporting distributed operations, the differences between SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) and API became blurred. In the context of FHIR we define APIs as REST based interfaces."
argonaut: "An initiative launched by HL7 to accelerate the development and adoption of FHIR. Supported by 11 organizations, including EHR vendors Epic and Cerner and health systems Mayo Clinic and Intermountain Healthcare."
cap: "The <i>Common Assurance Process</i> is an NHS process that needs to be followed to gain accreditation allowing for connection directly to the Spine and PDS."
ccda: "<i>Consolidated CDA</i> is an XML based implementation guide that specifies encoding, structure and semantics for a document that summarises a single patient’s clinical information."
ccg: "The <i>Clinical Commissioning Group</i> is an NHS organisation made up of GP practices looing understand the health needs of local people and use funds given by NHS England to buy services which meet those needs. Key challenges for our organisation are: tackling health inequalities and unwanted variations in quality of care, a growing elderly population with more long term conditions and a health and social care system in which any funding growth will be limited."
cda: "The <i>Clinical Document Architecture</i> provides an exchange model for clinical documents (such as discharge summaries and progress notes). By leveraging the use of XML, the HL7 V3 Reference Information Model (RIM) and coded vocabularies, CDA makes documents both machine-readable  and human-readable."
cib: "The Code 4 Health, <i>Community Interoperability Board</i> was established early in 2016. This network of networks has taken on a leadership role across the service to coordinate and deliver working interoperability standards."
cimi: "<i>Clinical Information Modeling Initiative</i> An international collaboration dedicated to providing a common format for detailed specifications for the representation of health information content. In this way semantically interoperable information may be created and shared in health records, messages, and documents."
