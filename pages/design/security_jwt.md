## Use of Bearer Tokens ###

An output of [authorising access](security_authorisation.html) to an API is the provision of a JSON Web Token. This MUST be passed in the API calls to ensure the systems being called are able to verify that the user has been authorised to see the resources requested. This JWT is also used for audit purposes, so the API implementation (and the SSP in the case of a call brokered through that service) can record the user context in it's audit trail.

In order to achieve this, the Consumer MUST include Access token in the HTTP authorisation header as an oAuth Bearer Token (as outlined in [RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749){:target="_blank"}) in the form of a JSON Web Token (JWT) as defined in [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519){:target="_blank"}.

An example such an HTTP header is given below:

```
     Authorization: Bearer jwt_token_string
```

API Provider systems SHALL respond to oAuth Bearer Token errors in line with [RFC 6750 - section 3.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-3.1).

It is highly recommended that standard libraries are used for creating the JWT as constructing and encoding the token manually may lead to issues with parsing the token. A good source of information about JWT and libraries to use can be found on the [JWT.io site](https://jwt.io/)


## JWT without an Authorisation Server ##

The new national authentication service is not yet in place, so it is not currently possible to request an Access token from that service. In the interim, Consumer systems are expected to either use a local service to generate tokens, or generate a new JWT for each API request themselves. When a JWT is constructed in this way it is not actually being used for Authorisation, rather it is there for audit, and the API provider will have to trust the calling system to apply appropriate Authorisation controls in their system before generating the JWT.

Note: When a client system generates a JWT, they should populate a URI for their system in the iss (issuer) claim in the token to identify the system that generated the token.

A consumer generated JSON Web Token (JWT) SHALL consisting of three parts seperated by dots `.`, which are:

- Header
- Payload
- Signature

### Header ###

Where Consumer systems are generating the JWT locally, they SHALL generate an Unsecured JSON Web Token (JWT) using the 'none' algorithm parameter in the header to indicate that no digital signature or MAC has been performed (please refer to section 6 of [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519){:target="_blank"} for details).

```json
{
  "alg": "none",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

### Payload ###

Consumers systems SHALL generate a JWT Payload conforming to the requirements set out in the [JWT Payload](#jwt-payload) section of this page.

### Signature ###

Consumer systems SHALL generate an empty signature.

### Complete JWT ###

The final output is three Base64url encoded strings separated by dots (note - there is some canonicalisation done to the JSON before it is Base64url encoded, which the JWT code libraries will do for you).

```shell
eyJhbGciOiJub25lIiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.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.
```

NOTE: The final section (the signature) is empty, so the JWT will end with a trailing `.` (this must not be omitted, otherwise it would be an invalid token).


## JWT Payload ##

The Payload section of the JWT shall be populated as follows:

| Claim | Mandatory | Description | Fixed Value | Dynamic Value |
|-------|----------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| iss | Y | URI of the system that granted authorisation, and issued the access token | No | Yes |
| sub | Y | ID for the user on whose behalf this request is being made. Will match either the `requesting_user`, `requesting_patient` (or `requesting_system` for unattended APIs) | No | Yes |
| aud | Y | API endpoint URL for the resource server the client is authorised to access | No | Yes |
| exp | Y | Expiration time integer after which this authorization MUST be considered invalid. | No | (now + 5 minutes) UTC time in seconds |
| iat | Y | The UTC time the JWT was created by the requesting system | No | now UTC time in seconds |
| reason_for_request | Y | Purpose for which access is being requested | `directcare`, `secondaryuses` or `patientaccess` | No |
| scope | Y | Data being requested | A range of possible scopes could be used, depending on the resources and operations being accessed - see [Scopes](security_scopes.html) | No |
| requesting_system | Y | Identifier for the system or device making the request | No | System or Device Identifier |
| requesting_organization | N | Organisation making the request | No | Organisation Identifier | 
| requesting_user | N | Health or Social Care professional making the request | No | User Identifier |
| requesting_patient | N | Citizen making the request | No | NHS Number |


### JWT Payload Example ###

This is an example of how the JWT might look for an authorized practitioner making a request to view a patient record:

```json
{
	"iss": "https://cas.nhs.uk",
	"sub": "https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/sds-role-profile-id|[SDSRoleProfileID]",
	"aud": "https://provider.thirdparty.nhs.uk/GP0001/STU3/1",
	"exp": 1469436987,
	"iat": 1469436687,
	"reason_for_request": "directcare",
	"scope": "patient/*.read",
	"requesting_system": "https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/accredited-system|[ASID]",
	"requesting_organization": "https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/ods-organization-code|[ODSCode]",
	"requesting_user": "https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/sds-role-profile-id|[SDSRoleProfileID]"
}
```

Where the Practitioner has both a local system identifier but no Spine identifier, then the a local identifier MAY be used with a suitable URI to identify the system/organisation that assigned the ID.

### Identifier Prefixes ###

All identifiers used in the JWT follow the same approach used for other FHIR identifiers - i.e. they have a prefix to identify the naming system the identifier comes from. This allows different naming systems to be used without any risk of confusion if the same identifier exists in different naming systems. The identifier should be a string, with the naming systen URI followed by a pipe symbol (\|), followed by the identifier value - i.e.:

```
[Naming system URI]|[Identifier]
```

For example:

```
https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/ods-organization-code|X09
```

Naming systems appropriate for specific types of identifiers are listed in the population guidance below.

### Population of JWT attributes ###

Common attributes are as defined in [rfc7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3){:target="_blank"} - but the below table provides specific guidance on the values of specific attributes:

| Attribute Name | Attribute Value Guidance |
| iss | (Issuer) For tokens issued by the national authentication solution, this will be the URL of that national service. For tokens issued by a different issuer, this will hold the URL for the issuer. |
| sub | (Subject) An identifier for the person or system that has been authorised for access. In most cases this will be an identifier for a member of staff, identified by a Spine URP ID (see [RBAC](security_rbac.html)) for details. In cases where the API is being accessed by a citizen, this will be the NHS Number of that individual. In unattended API calls where authorisation has been granted to a system rather than a user, the system identifier will be used here (i.e. the Spine ASID) |
| aud | (Audience) The URI for the API Endpoint. This will be the fully qualified endpoint address returned to the Consumer by the [SDS endpoint lookup service](build_endpoints.html) as the value of `nhsMhsEndPoint`. |
| reason_for_request | This identified the purpose for which the request is being made. This is currently limited to one of the following values: **directcare**, **secondaryuses** or **patientaccess**. |
| scope | This is a space-separated list of the [scopes](security_scopes.html) authorised for this user. Individual APIs will check this list to establish whether the authorisation grants access to the data being request by the client, and will reject the call if the appropriate scopes have not been granted in the token. |
| requesting_system | This is an identifier for the deployed client system that has been authorised to make API calls. In the case of Spine-enabled clients (or those using the [SSP](ssp_overview.html) to broker API calls), this will be a [Spine Accredited System ID](build_endpoints.html) (ASID)<br/>The naming system prefix for the ASID will be **https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/accredited-system** |
| requesting_organization | This is the ODS code of the care organisation from where the request originates.<br/>The naming system prefix for the ODS code will be **https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/ods-organization-code**<br/>This is likely to be mandatory for APIs used by professionals - the specific API documentation for each API will clarify whether this must be used. |
| requesting_practitioner | If this authorisation relates to a member of staff, this attribute will hold the Spine URP ID (see [RBAC](security_rbac.html)) for details. In this case, the value of this attribute will match the "sub" attribute value.<br/>The naming system prefix for the URP ID code will be **https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/sds-role-profile-id**<br/>Where national authorisation is not being used (e.g. where Spine is brokering a call to a local system that has authorised the API access directly), and a national SDS role profile ID can't be used, a local user identifier may be used instead.<br/>The naming system prefix for a local identifier will be a locally-defined URI specific to the system/service that managed the user identities - e.g. **https://my-care-service/Id/user-id**<br/>Where the user has both a local system 'role' as well as a nationally-recognised role, then the latter SHALL be provided. Default usernames (e.g. referring to systems or groups) SHALL NOT be used in this field.<br/>This is likely to be mandatory for APIs used by professionals - the specific API documentation for each API will clarify whether this must be used. | |
| requesting_patient | If this authorisation relates to a citizen, this attribute will hold the NHS Number of the citizen<br/>The naming system prefix for the NHS Number will be **http://fhir.nhs.net/Id/nhs-number**<br/>This is likely to be mandatory for APIs used by patienrs/citizens - the specific API documentation for each API will clarify whether this must be used. |


{% include important.html content="In topologies where Consumer applications are provisioned via a portal or middleware hosted by another organisation (see [Topologies](ssp_system_topologies.html)), it is important for audit purposes that the user and organisation populated in the JWT reflect the originating organisation rather than the hosting organisation." %}

## JWT Validation ##

Depending upon the client’s role, and the specific nature of the API being called, the validation that is applied to the JWT varies. Some validation is common to all JWTs however, and is outlined below. For API-specific validation, please refer to the relevant API specification.

Where there has been a validation failure then the following response will be returned to the client. In all instances the response will be the same however the diagnostics text will vary depending upon the nature of the error. 

| HTTP Code | issue-severity | issue-type | Details.Code | Details.Display | Diagnostics |
|-----------|----------------|------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
|400|error|structure|MISSING_OR_INVALID_HEADER|There is a required header missing or invalid|See scenarios below for examples|

### MISSING_OR_INVALID_HEADER Exception Scenarios: ###

Example 1: JWT missing – the Authorization header has not been supplied. The following response SHALL be returned to the client.

<i> Diagnostics - The Authorisation header must be supplied <i/>

<!--
| HTTP Code | issue-severity | issue-type | Details.Code | Details.Display | Diagnostics |
|-----------|----------------|------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
|400|error|<font color="red">structure</font> |MISSING_OR_INVALID_HEADER|There is a required header missing or invalid|The Authorisation header must be supplied|

Diagnostics - The Authorisation header must be supplied-->


Example 2: JWT structure invalid – the Authorization header is present however the value is not a structurally valid JWT ie one or more of the required elements of header, payload and signature is missing. 

<i> Diagnostics - The JWT associated with the Authorisation header must have the 3 sections <i/>

<!--
| HTTP Code | issue-severity | issue-type | Details.Code | Details.Display | Diagnostics |
|-----------|----------------|------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
|400|error|<font color="red">structure</font> |MISSING_OR_INVALID_HEADER|There is a required header missing or invalid|The JWT associated with the Authorisation header must have the 3 sections|

Diagnostics - The JWT associated with the Authorisation header must have the 3 sections -->


Example 3: Mandatory claim missing – the Authorization header is present and the JWT is structurally valid however one or more of the mandatory claims is missing from the JWT 

<i> Diagnostics - The mandatory claim [claim] from the JWT associated with the Authorisation header is missing <i/>


<!--
| HTTP Code | issue-severity | issue-type | Details.Code | Details.Display | Diagnostics |
|-----------|----------------|------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
|400|error|<font color="red">structure</font> |MISSING_OR_INVALID_HEADER|There is a required header missing or invalid|The mandatory claim [claim] from the JWT associated with the Authorisation header is missing|

Diagnostics - The mandatory claim [claim] from the JWT associated with the Authorisation header is missing -->

Example 4: Claim’s value is invalid - the Authorization header is present and the JWT is structurally valid a mandatory claim is present in the JWT however it’s value is not valid. The table below shows the various checking that is applied to each claim in the JWT and the associated diagnostics message:


| Claim being validated | Error scenario | Diagnostics | 
|-------|----------|-------------|
| sub | No requesting_user has been supplied and the sub claims’ value does not match the value of the requesting_system claim| requesting_system ([requesting_system]) and sub ([sub]) claim’s values must match| 
| sub | requesting_user has been supplied and the sub claims’ value does not match the value of the requesting_user claim | requesting_user ([requesting_user]) and sub ([sub]) claim’s values must match|
| scope | scope provided is not recognised (see [Security Scopes](security_scopes.html)). Specific APIs will require specific scopes - refer to the specific API specification for details of expected scopes.| Required scopes not found in token ([scope])
| requesting_system | Requesting system is not of the form [https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/accredited-system/[ASID] | requesting_system ([requesting_system]) must be of the form [https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/accredited-system/[ASID]] |
| requesting_system | Requesting system is not an ASID that is known to Spine | The ASID defined in the requesting_system ([ASID]) is unknown |
| requesting_system | Requesting system ASID in JWT does not match FromASID | The ASID defined in the requesting_system ([ASID]) does not match the FromASID in the request |
| requesting_organisation  | Requesting organisation is not of the form [https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/ods-organization-code/[ODSCode] | requesting_organisation ([requesting_ organisation]) must be of the form [https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/ods-organization-code/[ODSCode] |
| requesting_organisation  | Requesting organisation is not known to Spine | The ODS code defined in the requesting_organisation([ODS]) is unknown |
| requesting_organisation  | Requesting organisation is not associated with the ASID from the requesting_system claim  | requesting_system ASID ([ASID]) is not associated with the requesting_organisation ODS code ([ODS]) |

### Precedence of requesting_user over requesting_system ###

If both the `requesting_system` and `requesting_user` claims have been provided, then the `sub` claim MUST match the `requesting_user` claim.


## Example JWT for an authorised professional ##

The below is an example of how the JWT might look for a health or social care professional accessing a Spine Clinicals API to retrieve data about a patient:

```json
{
	"iss": "https://cas.nhs.uk",
	"sub": "https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/sds-role-profile-id|387429785309275",
	"aud": "https://clinicals.spineservices.nhs.uk",
	"exp": 1469436987,
	"iat": 1469436687,
	"reason_for_request": "directcare",
	"scope": "patient/*.read",
	"requesting_system": "https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/accredited-system|200000000205",
	"requesting_user": "https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/sds-role-profile-id|4387293874928"
}
```

## Example JWT for an "unattended" API call (i.e. with no user identity included) ##

The below is an example of how the JWT might look for an API call between two systems without a specific user context:

```json
{
	"iss": "https://cas.nhs.uk",
	"sub": "https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/accredited-system|200000000205",
	"aud": "https://clinicals.spineservices.nhs.uk",
	"exp": 1469436987,
	"iat": 1469436687,
	"reason_for_request": "directcare",
	"scope": "patient/*.read",
	"requesting_system": "https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/accredited-system|200000000205",
}
```

## Example JWT for an authorised citizen ##

The below is an example of how the JWT might look for a citizen accessing an API to retrieve and update information about their consent preferences:

```json
{
	"iss": "https://citizen-id.nhs.uk",
	"sub": "http://fhir.nhs.net/Id/nhs-number|6101231234",
	"aud": "https://clinicals.spineservices.nhs.uk",
	"exp": 1469436987,
	"iat": 1469436687,
	"reason_for_request": "patientaccess",
	"scope": "patient/consent.read patient/consent.write",
	"requesting_system": "https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/accredited-system|200000000205",
	"requesting_patient": "http://fhir.nhs.net/Id/nhs-number|6101231234"
}
```

In the above example:

- The access token was issued by the national Citizen identity service, so that service's URL is in the issuer (iss) field (this service does not exist yet, so the URL is an example only)
- The patient has been identified as having the NHS number **6101231234**
- The subject of the authorisation decision was the patient, so the **sub** value is the same as the **requesting_patient** value
- The service that provides the APIs being authorised is the Spine clinicals service, so the audience (aud) URL is for that service
- Issued and Expiry times are populated by the authorisation server to limit the lifetime of the access token
- The information is being requested by the patient, so the reason for the request is **patientaccess**
- The application developer has reviewed the API specification and identified that the scopes required for this data are: **patient/consent.read patient/consent.write**
- The patient is using an application that has been reviewed and approved for access to Spine services, and given a system ID of **200000000205**
