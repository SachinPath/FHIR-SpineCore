## 1. How they were created? ##

The search parameters have been created by amalgamating the thinking and search parameter definitions from public facing projects who have spent time looking and investigating API search parameters:
- Argonaut
- GP Connect
- Cerner
- AllScripts

The search parameters were created as a starting point for discussion as such a process to improve the search parameters and make them applicable and complete.

## 2. Sources ##



## 3. Improvement process ##

An improvement process needs to be developed to improve the search parameters and validate the ones already suggested. Please contact the careconnect team if you have any suggestions.
