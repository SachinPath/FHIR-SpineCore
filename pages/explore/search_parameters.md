## 1. How they were created? ##

The search parameters have been created by amalgamating the thinking and search parameter definitions from public facing projects who have spent time looking, investigating and implementing API search parameters:


- [Argonaut](http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/Conformance-server.html)
- [GP Connect](https://nhsconnect.github.io/gpconnect/accessrecord_rest.html)
- [Cerner](http://fhir.cerner.com/millennium/dstu2/)
- [AllScripts](https://developer.allscripts.com/)
- [EPIC](https://open.epic.com/Interface/FHIR)
- NHS Scotland
- [NHS Digital - GP Connect](https://nhsconnect.github.io/gpconnect/accessrecord_rest.html)

The search parameters were created as a starting point for discussion as such a process to improve the search parameters and make them applicable and complete.

## 2. Sources ##



## 3. Improvement process ##

An improvement process needs to be developed to improve the search parameters and validate the ones already suggested. Please contact the careconnect team if you have any suggestions.
