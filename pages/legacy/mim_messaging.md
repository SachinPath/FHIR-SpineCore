summary: "An introduction to the Message Implementation Manual (MiM)"
---

Much of the messaging originally developed in Spine by BT under the National Programme for IT (NPFiT) used HL7v3 standards, and the specific message content was defined in a set of web pages referred to as the "Message Implementation Manual".

Several versions of this Message Implementation Manual are available [here](https://developer.nhs.uk/library/interoperability/message-implementation-manuals-mims/).

{% include note.html content="These pages will be updated in future versions to provide additional information about the legacy MiM messaging on Spine." %}
