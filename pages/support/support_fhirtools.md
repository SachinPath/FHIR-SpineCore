##[Simplifier.net](https://simplifier.net/)

<img src="images/support/simplifier.png" alt="Simplifier Screenshot" style="width:20%; float:right; margin-left:3%;">Simplifier.net is a FHIR registry, a website for managing, sharing and finding FHIR profiles and Implementation Guides.

The Simplifier.net FHIR registry supports the following functions:
* Uploading profiles
* Downloading profiles
* Finding profiles
* Viewing FHIR Conformance Resources
* Simplifier.net also offers functionality for management of FHIR Resources and collaboration within teams.

Simplifier.net distinguishes between free (personal) plans and paid plans. Anyone can find and download Resources in this Registry, with or without an account. Creating Resources requires an account. Paid plans are targeted at professional users and organisations.
The registry contains both projects and resources, and a quick scan can reveal hundreds of profiles that have been defined although they do range quite significantly in quality.
