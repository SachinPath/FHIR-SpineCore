summary: "A number of resource definitions, while presented as human-readable, they may be served up by a FHIR Reference API Server"

As each reference is described, the following features will be highlighted:
* Profiles indicates that complete profiles are displayed and is typically expected in any reference site displaying Resources.
* Delta indicates that the site specifically highlights the difference between the displayed Resource and the HL7 core definition.
* Examples of the resource populated with data.
* Structured views are profile views displayed in a graphical tree structure.
* UML views show profiles as UML class diagrams.
* XML indicates that a Resource’s structure can be displayed in an XML format.
* JSON indicates that a Resource’s structure can be displayed in a JSON format.
* Value Sets are the associated values that relate to defined Resources.
* Operations such as predefined searches are described within the reference server.
