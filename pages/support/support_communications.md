## [INTEROpen](http://http://www.interopen.org/)

INTEROPen is an OPEN collaboration of individuals, industry, standards organisations and health and care providers, who have agreed to work together to accelerate the development of open standards for interoperability in the health and social care sector.

<img src="images/overview/connect.jpg" alt="Image of two hands holding a jigsaw piece" style="width:20%; float:left"> INTEROPen aims to provide a forum to collaborate on the design and application of technical interoperability standards. The areas covered by the group include data exchange, data validation, defining APIs and governance. It is an action group whereby members commit to design, validation and demonstration using real systems.
Commercial interests are put to one side in the groupâ€™s activities.
