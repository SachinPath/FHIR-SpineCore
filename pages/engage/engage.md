# User Stories #

It is recommended that user stories are created to identify and document requirements. This implementation guide uses non-technical stories as the foundation for identifying requirements and mapping to Care Connect profiles. This provides a reference point to help with the identification of requirements and profiles.
Within the initial phase of the Care Connect API roadmap, on behalf of INTEROPen, NHS Digital are building a catalogue of user stories to support proof of concept work. The vision for this catalogue is that it can be opened up for direct contributions from the community providing a referenceable catalogue, linking requirements, solutions and case studies providing further education back to the community.
